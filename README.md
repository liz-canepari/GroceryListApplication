# Overview

This project is a grocery list management app designed to enhance organizational skills and explore data persistence in mobile app development. The app allows users to create multiple grocery lists, add items to each list, and easily switch between lists. This functionality aims to simulate a real-world, user-friendly application, improving my skills in Java, Android development, and implementing local storage.

The app opens with a screen displaying the currently selected grocery list. Users can add items to the list, create new lists, and select existing lists. Each list is saved using Android’s SharedPreferences, allowing the user to retain their lists and items even after the app is closed and reopened.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I developed this app in Android Studio using Java as the primary programming language. Key libraries and tools used include:

* Gson for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa, making data storage and retrieval efficient.
* Android SharedPreferences to handle data persistence for grocery lists.
* RecyclerView to display the list items dynamically.

The project was built for Android devices, with an emphasis on Android’s UI components and user-interaction patterns.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Improve UI/UX: Add more visual feedback (e.g., confirmation dialogues or animations) to improve the user experience.
* Add Item Categories: Allow users to organize items by categories like produce, dairy, etc., for a more structured list.
* Support for Multiple Users: Implement user accounts or multiple profiles so each user can maintain their own grocery lists.
* Cloud Sync: Add a feature to back up lists to the cloud for access across multiple devices.
